# SMServerLib

My intent is to use this both in iOS apps and server-side apps. 

Installed using the swift package manager:

let package = Package(
    name: "MyProject",
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/crspybits/SMServerLib.git", majorVersion: 0),
        ...
    ]
    ...
)
